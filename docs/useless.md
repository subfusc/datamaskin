# Useless

[Back](/datamaskin/)

A collecion of largely uselss commands, but perhaps you still want any of them.

## Commands
- `coin`, `toss`, `cointoss`: flip a coin. Will tell you if you get `Heads` or `Tails`
- `readmyconfig?` Check if Useless managed to read its config
- `cronjobs?` Check if cronjob commands are sendt to the plugins
- `8ball` Shake an 8 ball and get a vague answe
- `{number}d{sides}` Throw x number of dices with y sides (e.g. `2d6`, throw 2 6-sided dice)


## Listening
- Trying to tell the bot to shut up will make it tell you to fuck off.
- Asking about the natural universe will return an irrelevant fact
