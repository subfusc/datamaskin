## Listen

This plugin is listening to different things, and will pick up things
like `++object`, `object++` that will heighten the karma of the object
by one. `--object`, `object--` will decrease the karma of an object by
one.

If you don't like the C-style, you can alternatively use Common Lisp
style to increase or decrease the karma of an object, `(incf object)`
and `(decf object)` respectively. `incf` and `decf` can take an
integer argument as last argument, with a max of 3. Example: `(incf
object 3)`

The last way to increase karma is to use latex style
`\addtocounter{object}{number}`, the max here is also 3.
